Redis
=====

Redis emits the following warnings upon boot, which we don't do anything
about (for now, or forever) as addressing them for all installations
might create other problems with other apps on the same server.

* WARNING overcommit_memory is set to 0! Background save may fail under
  low memory condition. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1'
  to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command
  'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.

* WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled in your
  kernel. This will create latency and memory usage issues with Redis.
  To fix this issue run the command
  'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as root,
  and add it to your /etc/rc.local in order to retain the setting after
  a reboot. Redis must be restarted after THP is disabled.

Postgresql
==========

Unlike gladiwashere-php-postgresql, Mastodon creates and manages its own
tables. So all database objects are owned by the provisioned database
user, and not postgres.

Upon restore (and during upgrade), the data is restored as user postgres,
however, and so the ownership needs to be set to the (newly provisioned)
database user instead.
